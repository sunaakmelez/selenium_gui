As a Computer Engineering project, a webcrawler was created using the Selenium framework.
It looks for information of academics for Computer Engineering of YTU. In line with this information, it creates a report on the number of publications of the relevant academician(s).
At the same time, it sends requests to all links on the pages by going down to the desired level in a given base URL, finds broken links and reports them.
A GUI has been created to take the inputs such as academicians, publication type, broken link base urls from the user.
